# Milton Innovation Center Project Showcase

## Project Description
This is a student-centered interactive website for the Milton Innovation Center. It allows students to:
- Browse available project areas (3D Printing, Laser Cutting, Woodshop, Embroidery)
- Submit their own projects with descriptions and images
- View a gallery of all student-submitted projects

Built as a capstone project, this site showcases integration of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript along with localStorage to manage persistent dataâ€”all built without a backend.

## Summary of Features
- Multi-page website: index.html, projects.html, gallery.html, and submit.html
- Responsive layout using Flexbox and media queries
- Semantic HTML structure across all pages
- Project submission form with client-side validation
- Project data (including images) stored in localStorage
- Dynamic DOM manipulation to display projects in the gallery
- Clean, unified navigation menu across all pages
- Mobile-friendly design

## Course Concepts Demonstrated

Semantic HTML:
- Use of header, nav, main, section, and footer for page structure

CSS Styling and Flexbox:
- Responsive grid layout and consistent styling across pages

JavaScript Functions and Event Handling:
- Functions handle form validation, DOM updates, and localStorage interactions
- Event listeners process user input and manage dynamic behaviors

Data Persistence:
- Uses localStorage to store and retrieve project submissions across sessions

File Handling:
- Uses the FileReader API to convert image uploads into base64 for display

Navigation:
- Provides a consistent top menu for easy access to all pages

## Deployment
This site is fully deployable via GitHub Pages or any static hosting service. Simply upload the full directory or push to your GitHub repository and enable Pages.
